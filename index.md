## About Me

I'm a Jakarta-based economist with a strong interest in development economics and industrial policy, particularly focusing on applying computational and data-driven methods to economic analysis. My background combines a Master's degree in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Indonesia.

My research, published in journals like *Economics & Human Biology*, *Agricultural Finance Review*, *Bulletin of Monetary Economics and Banking*, *Gadjah Mada International Journal of Business*, and *Jurnal Ekonomi Indonesia*, explores diverse, interconnected topics:

* **Development Economics:** Tourism's impact on poverty and income, green budgeting in local governments, social infrastructure needs in Asia.
* **Education & Labor Markets:** Effects of Ramadan on academic performance, comparison of higher education admission systems.
* **Trade & Industrial Policy:** SME export propensity, impacts of trade liberalization, industrial clustering dynamics.
* **Financial Inclusion & Microeconomics:** Microfinance effects, depositor behavior, the role of FinTech.

Currently, at PROSPERA, I contribute to research on emerging sectors and industrial policy, applying analytical skills to development challenges. I am passionate about leveraging data and technology to inform economic policy and am always seeking opportunities for research and collaboration.
