## About Me

I am a Jakarta-based economist bridging the gap between economic policy and data science. With a Master's in Computer & Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Indonesia, I specialize in applying computational and data-driven techniques to development economics and industrial policy challenges.

My work focuses on generating actionable insights from data to inform policy in areas like financial inclusion, trade, green transitions, and SME development. I have a proven track record of research published in peer-reviewed journals and experience translating complex analysis into practical recommendations.

Passionate about leveraging technology for economic progress, I thrive at the intersection of rigorous economic research and cutting-edge data analysis.
