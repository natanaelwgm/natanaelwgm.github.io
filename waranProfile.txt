I'm an Jakarta-based, aspiring economist with a keen interest in development economics and industrial policy, focusing on applying computer-scientific and data-driven approaches to economic analysis. My educational background includes a Master's degree in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Indonesia. I've been fortunate to have my research published in peer-reviewed journals such as Economics & Human Biology, Agricultural Finance Review, Bulletin of Monetary Economics and Banking, Gadjah Mada International Journal of Business, and Jurnal Ekonomi Indonesia. My work covers various interconnected topics in economics and development, reflecting my curiosity and the multidisciplinary nature of these fields. In my studies related to development economics, I've had the opportunity to explore topics like tourism's impact on poverty alleviation and income distribution, green budgeting practices in Indonesian local governments, and social infrastructure needs in Asia. I've also been able to contribute to research in education and labor markets, examining the effects of Ramadan on academic performance and comparing merit-based and test-based higher education admission systems. My research interests have led me to investigate trade and industrial policy, where I've looked into factors affecting SMEs' export propensity, potential impacts of trade liberalization with China on poverty in Indonesia, and industrial clustering dynamics. In the realm of financial inclusion and microeconomics, I've studied the effects of microfinance on rural households, depositor behavior, and the role of financial technology in promoting financial inclusion. To complement my academic pursuits, I've been privileged to work with organizations like PROSPERA, where I contribute to research on emerging sectors and industrial policy. This role, along with other professional experiences, has allowed me to apply analytical skills to various development issues across different countries. I'm always eager to learn and contribute to the field of economics and development policy, and I look forward to future opportunities for research and collaboration.

		[Am glad to be starting my study period as a remote-learning master's degree students at the Master's of Computer and Information Technology program,](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6684167099981676544?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6684167099981676544%29)[Penn Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/company/penn-engineering/),[University of Pennsylvania](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-pennsylvania/)!  
	  
	The whole process felt surreal and I am (and will always be) deeply indebted to all the people who had helped me along the way. I felt blessed to have worked with great colleagues and mentors that have always prioritized the impacts our projects are making, yet still managing to push the limits of being creative and investigative with data and algorithms that we produced. Hopefully, I can help enrich the current arsenal of tools we have with even more cutting-edge methods.  
	  
	If I can, in any way, be of help to any of you; if you are either wondering about the degree / program, the application process, or even computer science / data science in general, kindly hit me up and I will do my best to assist you! I have always believed that the foremost way to learn is indeed to share it with others, and I am not fazed one bit to change any of that!  
	  
	Intriguingly enough, this Fall marks my first moments as an engineering student (at least I got that from my faculty!). Looking forward to having a good mix-up between that and the economist part of me -- and everything in between!

		[As ASEAN put forward aviation industry liberalization measures in 2010, the Indonesian industry has been moving towards \*the other side of spectrum\* of late. Two market ventures driving the change was in late 2018, where one of the leading airlines group, Garuda Group, through Citilink agreed to form cooperation with Sriwijaya Air. Second, January 2019 further marked the period in which Lion Air started charging ‘baggage fees’ and Garuda Indonesia stopped offering sub class ticket. This study aims to discuss the complete breakdown of the market concentration and landscape. We find an \*intriguingly similar\* capacity and passenger drop in the period following the Citilink – Sriwijaya deal conducted by VIRTUALLY ALL THE MEMBERS of Garuda Group and Lion Air Group – all against the year-on-year trend (Figures 4.1 to 4.9). Interestingly, such drop is not associated with exchange rate and/or (international) avtur prices (graphed in figures). Domestic flights' price-to-profit ratio (LPEM estimate) are also shown to be higher than international flights' (Tables 4 & 5). Check out the full study by LPEM:

		[A funny morning meal -- I met the thesis advisors of my thesis advisor! Indeed, I met both the undergrad thesis advisor (Mr Iwan Jaya Azis) and the graduate-level thesis advisor (Mr Hal Hill) of my very own thesis advisor Mr Chatib Basri whom I respect dearly. I hope this makes me triple as wise (jk still FAR from catching up on em tho) 🤔

	.  
	Anyhow, was actually in Bali to attend the launching of a particular journal I helped make. Humbled to be co-authoring Pak Revi and Bu Sri Mulyani (STILL felt surreal) on a piece about SMEs export barriers. As it turned out, what the businesses perceive as the prominent barriers may differ HUGELY from the government's, vice versa.

	- - I first knew Waran in my first year of college years ago. He is genuine, genius, hardworking, and a street-smart in the field of research especially related to data processing. He is a type of senior that not only become the inspiration for many juniors but also has a significant impact on some of them including me. When I confused to choose my internship he recommended me to try data science and IBM which turned out become one of the monumental moments in my college journey. I am really grateful and proud to call him my senior, mentor, and friend. I believe that he will continue to develop his skills and at the same time creating values to the society. Good luck and Godspeed Kak Waran!

- A Comparison between Merit-based and Test-based Higher Education Admission in Indonesia
	LPEM FEB UI Working Papers · Jan 1, 2019
	- - The undergraduate admissions in Indonesia’s public universities are interestingly conducted in a two-fold system. Students are?rst considered for the merit-based ‘Undangan’ admissions, whereas the test-based admissions are conducted afterwards. This study aims to discuss the differences of academic performances of students entering universities through the merit-based and test-based admissions. Our discussion utilizes a comprehensive data of 5,470 freshmen admitted during the period 2001 to 2017 at the Faculty of Economics and Business of Universitas Indonesia. We observed the differences using regression and matching estimates controlling the students’ characteristics and demographics. The?ndings suggest that students admitted through the Undangan system perform generally betterHowever, such difference of academic performance diminishes across time. Furthermore, we describe the potential problems and, at the same time, progress for the country’s education system posed by the phenomenon.
- Financial Technology in Indonesia: A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion?
	LPEM FEB UI Working Papers · Jan 1, 2019
	- - This study aims to delve deeper into the discussion on how the financial inclusion progress in Indonesia could be affected by the growing fintech industry. We shall comprehensively discuss the current state of the platforms in the country, including the potential benefits and challenges. Such afflictions include the hugely-concentrated deposit market, to begin with and the discrepancies between regulators and the technological changes, while the high internet and mobile phone penetration are only one of the many advantages the country are endowed with. The study aims to highlight the challenges faced in increasing financial inclusion before the fintech platforms begin to flourish and how they differ to the current condition. Novel and relevant policy recommendations are also provided in the latter parts of the discussion.
